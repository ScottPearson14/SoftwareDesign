# Scott Pearson - Software Design Portfolio

This repository showcases Java projects created for the Software Design course at the University of Iowa. Projects cover object-oriented programming, GUI applications, multithreading, and client-server networking. Each folder contains source code and documentation.

> **NOTE:** All projects were developed and tested using **IntelliJ IDEA**. Some features (especially JavaFX and JUnit tests) may not work as expected if the environment is not configured correctly (e.g., missing dependencies, incorrect Java version, or file paths).
